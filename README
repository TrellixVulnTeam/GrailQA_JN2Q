This runs the server of our leaderboard for GrailQA.

Once we get a new submission, run: cl-competitiond -v grailqa.yml output.json
, by which the submission can be evaluated.
After several seconds, run the above command again to retrive the metrics.

Then we will get an updated output.json, replace this new file with the old
 one under GrailQA-explorer (i.e., run cp output.json ../GrailQA-explorer),
and recompile it to update the webpage content.
